    <h2> About Me</h2>
    <hr size=3 noshade>
    I grew up in Vancouver, Washington.  I finished my senior year at Washington State
    University in Plymouth, England and stayed for an extra year working at a school
    in Ashford, England.  College was my first experience with the freedom of travel and independence
    and I enjoy long adventures with my kids nowadays.  We spent one summer exploring the US, one exploring
    Vancouver island and another wandering around Europe. I hope to go on another
    trip to explore more of Canada and Glacier National Park this summer. I love the
    freedom my life provides and the joy my family gives me.  There is something beautiful
    and sad and confusing about life and I do enjoy all the parts of it.
